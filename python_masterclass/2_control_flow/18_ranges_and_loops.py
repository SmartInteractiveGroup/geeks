# for loops with ranges (ranges how many times we want the code to run)

# for i in range(5):     # 0 1 2 3 4 - 5 is not inclusive
#     print(i)

# for i in range(10,20): #no 20 off course
#     print(i)

# for i in range(10,20,2): #2 is a step
#     print(i)

# negative steps

# for i in range(10,0,-1):  # need to be -1! no 0 as it is inclusive
#     print(i)

for i in range(20,10,-2): # no 10....
    print(i)
